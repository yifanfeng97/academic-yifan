I'm currently a second-year intelligent science and technology M.S. student in the [School of Informatics and Science](https://informatics.xmu.edu.cn/) at [Xiamen University](https://www.xmu.edu.cn/). I am advised by Professor [Rongrong Ji](https://mac.xmu.edu.cn/). At the same time, I have joined the iMoon-Lab since 2017.2 ( supervised by Professor [Yue Gao](http://gaoyue.org/cn/index)). My research interests include Complex Network, 3D Vision, Graph Theory, Algebraic Topology, and Brain Science.
